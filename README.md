# Bangla-food-detection
This project is a Machine learning capstone project. I doing this project in my academic life with our university team.<br>
In this project, we collect 58 classes of Bangla food image data for the image classification model and build an ensemble CNN model. We get 97.5% accuracy from this model.<br>
After building our model we implement this model in a web application.<br>
